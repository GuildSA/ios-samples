// We can use if-statements to have our code take some action if some
// condition is true. The most basic control structure is the if-statement.

var health = 0

// If the player's health is less than or equal to 0 - print "You're dead!"
if health <= 0 {
    print( "You're dead!" )
}

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Next, the if-else statement allows us to pick one of two possible actions instead
// of a all-or-nothing choice.

health = 75

// If the player's health is less than or equal to 0 - print "You're dead!"
// Otherwise, print "You're alive!".

// The final form of an if-statement, uses an else-if combination to pick from
// one of several possible actions by chaining two or more if statements
// together.

health = 24

// If the player's health is less than or equal to 0 - print "You're dead!"
// But if the player is not dead, and the player's health is less than 25 -
