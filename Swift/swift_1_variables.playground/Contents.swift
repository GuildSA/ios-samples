// You can declare multiple constants or multiple variables on a single line
// if you separate them by commas:

var health = 100, armor = 25, goldCoins = 10, rubies = 5

// Variable and constant names can contain almost any character, including
// Unicode characters such as the symbol for Pi or emojis.

// To insert an emoji use: Command + Ctrl + Spacebar
// In most cases, you should really avoid this!

// One of the possible valid uses of this would be for programmers to write
// their code in their own native language.
let ‰Ω†Â•Ω = "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå"

// Swift gives us several built-in functions which we are designed to help us out.
// For example, we can use the print() function to print our data to the console.

// If we want to build-up a String using some of our variables, we can use
// string interpolation to include the name of a constant or variable
// into another string.

// To do this, wrap the var name in parentheses and escape it with a backslash
// before the opening parenthesis.
//
// Like this:   \(varName)
